# Start Here

## Goals
* Learn stuff, hands-on, like Kubernetes, GitOps, networking (SSL, VLANs, DNS, DHCP), and routing (hardware, OSS)
* Keep it low(ish) power, with backups and smart server power control
* Have access to VMs for prototyping and development
* Host all of my favorite local apps
* Make it all easily deployable and as "highly available" as possible for a homelab
