256GB NVMe
8GB DDR4
Intel 210 NIC 1xGBe NIC

## Hardware
### Prototype
Since the NIC I originally purchased was bad, I used a USB NIC to test the setup. Although most suggest against using USB NICs due to reliability issues, I had great performance. I didn't get around to testing speed or latency, but it performed equivalently to my Asus RT-AC68U router. 

## Software
